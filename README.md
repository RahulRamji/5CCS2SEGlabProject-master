A project based around the design and implementation of a website for the 
King's College London Chess Society. This website will proviode functionality for
members of the society, including the ability to read news articles, view upcoming
tournaments, edit their accounts and much more. 

This site is also intended to be used by officials, of which they will be able to
create news articles, tournaments and events. Admins will be able to set who is 
an officer and who is not.

This project is split into different sections for which the team will be focussing on 
aspects of:
<ul>    
<li>Front-end design; creating the HTML pages with CSS to provide a visually pleasing front-end. </li>
<li>Database design; creating and maintaining a database which conforms to the rules of Normal Form. </li>
<li>PHP linking; writing the code to enable to html pages to communicate with the database, also
provide functionality of a login / sign up process. </li>
</ul>

Within this project, it is also very important for the process of the work to be recorded accurately, with
documentation of every team meeting to be written on Team Feedback and for the git and trello boards to conform
to a business standard.
